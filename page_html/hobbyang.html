I dont have a particular subject to talk about so, im going to talk about my experiences around sports.
            <br>
            <br>
My first sport was gymnastic, I started at the age of 6 until I was 11 years old. It was an overall good experience, I played 2 to 3 times a week with the aim to get a decent level. I even got to play in tournaments, but i'll always finish last. That's a part of the reason why I left gymnastic but I will always remember it because I learned a lot about my self.
<br>
            <br>
After getting bored and finishing last at gymnastic, I wanted to try something new when I discovered handball. This team sport was in the first place very appealing to me until I tried it. In fact I got to play with on of the best team in the whole Grand Est but the problem was that they were not very friendly about begginers in their team. I got a lot of hate for being "bad" yet i was just a beginner, and I left the team after just one year.
<br>
            <br>
My last sports was Tennis, I started it in the middle of middle school and finished it at the start of high school.Tennis was for me a good sport and I didnt wanted to play it too seriously like in gymnastic or handball because for me it just remove the fun you can have playing a sport. I was proposed to make tournaments, but i'll always refuse not because I was scared but because I still wanted to have a good time playing Tennis.
